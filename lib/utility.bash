# UTILITY
#
# Functions which perform useful but more complex and less essential tasks.

# usage: realpath <path>
# attempts to resolve all symlinks until the origin path is discovered
# circular symlinks will keep it looping forever
realpath() {
  p="$1"
  # loop until the file is no longer a symlink (or doesn't exist)
  while [[ -h $p ]]; do
    d="$( cd -P "$( dirname "$p" )" && pwd )"

    # we need to resolve it relative to the path where the symlink file was located
    [[ $p != /* ]] && p="$d/$p"
  done
  cd -P "$(dirname "$p")" && pwd
}

# usage: elapsed <start_time> <end_time>
# takes two unix timestamps with nanoseconds
# returns the difference in human-readable format
